        In principle, you can use a group here.
        But please note that there are problems with position detection for a group of covers!
        For example, one cover may be at position 100% and the other cover at position 0%.
        This results in a wrong group-value of 50%.


        My clear recommendation is to create **one automation for each cover**.

            This basically determines whether the cover is allowed to open or close.
            <br /><br />
            Normally, the daily opening and closing of the roller blinds is controlled by a timer (see below).
            These first two options must be activated so that the blinds can be opened or closed at all.
            <br /><br />
            <ins>In addition to the time control</ins>, the height of the sun and a brightness sensor can also influence the daily opening and closing.
            In this case, options 3 or 4 must be activated.
            <br />
            Up to this point, <ins>none of this has anything to do with sun protection</ins>.
            This is activated in the last option.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Important note:</strong>
            The configuration of the Cover Status Helper is <ins>mandatory</ins> if you want to use the the ventilation mode or sun protection / sunshade control.

            This can be extended by further conditions (see below). However, it is important that the options are still activated here.
            Otherwise the conditions will not take effect.


            **Please ensure that the corresponding sensors are also specified.**
            For example, the brightness control only works if a brightness sensor is also specified.
