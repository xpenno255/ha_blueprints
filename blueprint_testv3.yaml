        In principle, you can use a group here.
        But please note that there are problems with position detection for a group of covers!
        For example, one cover may be at position 100% and the other cover at position 0%.
        This results in a wrong group-value of 50%.


        My clear recommendation is to create **one automation for each cover**.
